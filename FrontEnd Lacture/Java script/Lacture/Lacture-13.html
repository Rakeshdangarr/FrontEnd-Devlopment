    <h1>what is function?</h1>
    <p>
      Functions are a set of instructions bundled together to achieve a specific
      outcome. Functions are an excellent alternative to having repeating blocks
      of code in a program. Functions also increase the reusability of code.
      Values can be passed to a function using variables â€” we call these
      parameters or arguments. Functions can also return values.
    </p>

    <h2>why we use function?</h2>
    <p>
      The functions <b>eliminate code complexity by enabling re-usability.</b> A
      function is a block of 'reusable code' that is used several times in the
      JavaScript program where it is defined. JavaScript functions cut out the
      need to write the same code again, allowing modular coding.
    </p>

    <h2>types of function</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Named Functions</li>
      <p>
        Named functions are function declarations that include a name. They are
        also sometimes referred to as traditional functions or function
        declarations.
      </p>
      <b>example</b>
      <br />
      function helloFunction() { console.log('Hello Function!'); }
      <br />
      <p>
        Named functions are typically used when the same code needs to be
        executed multiple times throughout a program. They should always be
        declared before they are used.
      </p>

      <li>Anonymous fuction & Arrow Function</li>
      <b> describe bellow</b>
    </ol>

    <h1>what is Anonymous fucntion?</h1>
    It is a function that does not have any name
    <mark>associated with it</mark>. Normally we use the function keyword before
    the function name to define a function in JavaScript,<mark>
      however, in anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function
      keyword without the function name.</mark
    >
    <p>
      An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation, it can
      only be accessed by a variable it is stored in as a function as a value.
      An anonymous function can also have multiple arguments, but only one
      expression.
    </p>

    <b
      >We may also declare an anonymous function using the
      <b> arrow function technique </b> which is shown below:</b
    >
    <br />
    <b> ( () => { // Function Body... } )();</b>
