      React js directory systems :

      node_modules : node_modules is a package | module | library installer of react js app all packages and modules are installed inside of node_modules. React main module React and React-DOM is comming from node_modules
          App.jsx
          import React from 'react';
          import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

            examples :  App.jsx
                        Services.jsx
                        About.jsx
