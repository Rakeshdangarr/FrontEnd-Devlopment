    <h1>static website</h1>
    <p>
      Static web pages are made of “fixed code,” and unless the site developer
      makes changes, nothing will change on the page. Think of it like a
      brochure for a business. Static sites give a lot of the same type of
      information that you could get from a brochure, but it can't just change
      itself
