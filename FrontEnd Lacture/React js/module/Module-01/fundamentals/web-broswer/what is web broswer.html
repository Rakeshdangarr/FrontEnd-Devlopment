      The web browser is an application software to explore www (World Wide
      Web). It provides an interface between the server and the client and it
      requests to the server for web documents and services. It works as a
      compiler to render HTML which is used to design a webpage. Whenever we
      search for anything on the internet, the browser loads a web page written
      in HTML, including text, links, images, and other items such as style
      sheets and JavaScript functions. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla
      Firefox, and Safari are examples of web browsers.
