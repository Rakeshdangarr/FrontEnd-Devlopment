    <p>
      An absolute URL is a complete URL that contains all the information needed
      to find a resource on a local or networked computer. It includes the
      protocol (http or https), the domain (example.com), the path (which
      includes the directory and slug), and optionally, a subdomain (www).
      Absolute URLs can also include query parameters or fragment identifiers to
      specify additional data or direct to a specific section of a page.
