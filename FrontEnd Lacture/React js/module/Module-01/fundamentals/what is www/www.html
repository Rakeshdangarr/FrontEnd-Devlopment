      WWW stands for World Wide Web and is commonly known as the Web. The WWW
      was started by CERN in 1989. WWW is defined as the collection of different
      websites around the world, containing different information shared via
      local servers(or computers).

      Web pages are linked together using hyperlinks which are HTML-formatted
      and, also referred to as hypertext, these are the fundamental units of the
      Internet and are accessed through Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP). Such
      digital connections, or links, allow users to easily access desired
      information by connecting relevant pieces of information. The benefit of
      hypertext is it allows you to pick a word or phrase from the text and
      click on other sites that have more information about it.
