    <h1>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h1>
    <p>
      Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a process that helps search engines
      understand a website's content and helps users find it in search results.
      The goal of SEO is to improve a website's technical configuration,
      content, and link popularity so that it's more relevant and popular to
      users' search queries, and search engines rank it higher. Higher rankings
      in search engines can lead to more traffic to a website, which is often
      called "organic search traffic"
