    <h1>protocol</h1>
    <p>
      Internet Protocols are a set of rules that governs the communication and
      exchange of data over the internet. Both the sender and receiver should
      follow the same protocols in order to communicate the data. In order to
      understand it better, letâ€™s take an example of a language. Any language
      has its own set of vocabulary and grammar which we need to know if we want
      to communicate in that language. Similarly, over the internet whenever we
      access a website or exchange some data with another device then these
      processes are governed by a set of rules called the internet protocols.

    <h3>HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)</h3>
    <p>
      This protocol is used to transfer hypertexts over the internet and it is
      defined by the www(world wide web) for information transfer. This protocol
      defines how the information needs to be formatted and transmitted. And, it
      also defines the various actions the web browsers should take in response
      to the calls made to access a particular web page. Whenever a user opens
      their web browser, the user will indirectly use HTTP as this is the
      protocol that is being used to share text, images, and other multimedia
      files on the World Wide Web.
    </p>
    <h3>HTTPS(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)</h3>
    <p>
      HTTPS is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is
      used for secure communication over a computer network with the SSL/TLS
      protocol for encryption and authentication. So, generally, a website has
      an HTTP protocol but if the website is such that it receives some
      sensitive information such as credit card details, debit card details,
      OTP, etc then it requires an SSL certificate installed to make the website
      more secure. So, before entering any sensitive information on a website,
      we should check if the link is HTTPS or not. If it is not HTTPS then it
      may not be secure enough to enter sensitive information.
