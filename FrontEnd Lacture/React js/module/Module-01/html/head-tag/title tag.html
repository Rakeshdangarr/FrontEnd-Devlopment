      The title tag is an HTML code tag that allows you to give a web page a
      title. This title can be found in the browser title bar, as well as in the
      search engine results pages (SERP). It's crucial to add and optimise your
      website's title tags, as they play an essential role in terms of organic
      ranking (SEO).
