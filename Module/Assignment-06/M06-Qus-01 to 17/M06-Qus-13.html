    <b>Qus:</b> What is the function of the delete operator? <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <p>
      The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's
      value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the
      object held by that property is eventually released automatically.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The delete operator has the same precedence as other unary operators like
      typeof. Therefore, it accepts any expression formed by higher-precedence
      operators. However, the following forms lead to early syntax errors in
      strict mode:
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        delete identifier; <br />
        delete object.#privateProperty; <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Because classes are automatically in strict mode, and private properties
      can only be legally referenced in class bodies, this means private
      properties can never be deleted. While delete identifier may work if
      identifier refers to a configurable property of the global object, you
      should avoid this form and prefix it with globalThis instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      While other expressions are accepted, they don't lead to meaningful
      behaviors:
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        delete console.log(1); <br />
        // Logs 1, returns true, but nothing deleted <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The delete operator removes a given property from an object. On successful
      deletion, it will return true, else false will be returned. Unlike what
      common belief suggests (perhaps due to other programming languages like
      delete in C++), the delete operator has nothing to do with directly
      freeing memory. Memory management is done indirectly via breaking
      references. See the memory management page for more details.
    </p>
    <b>It is important to consider the following scenarios:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the property which you are trying to delete does not exist, delete
        will not have any effect and will return true.
      </li>

      <li>
        delete only has an effect on own properties. If a property with the same
        name exists on the object's prototype chain, then after deletion, the
        object will use the property from the prototype chain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Non-configurable properties cannot be removed. This includes properties
        of built-in objects like Math, Array, Object and properties that are
        created as non-configurable with methods like Object.defineProperty().
      </li>
      <li>
        Deleting variables, including function parameters, never works. delete
        variable will throw a SyntaxError in strict mode, and will have no
        effect in non-strict mode.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Any variable declared with var cannot be deleted from the global
            scope or from a function's scope, because while they may be attached
            to the global object, they are not configurable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any variable declared with let or const cannot be deleted from the
            scope within which they were defined, because they are not attached
            to an object.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
