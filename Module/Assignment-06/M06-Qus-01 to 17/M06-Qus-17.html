    <b>Qus:</b> What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <p>
      The innerHTML property is a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) that
      is used to set or return the HTML content of an element. Where the return
      value represents the text content of the HTML element. It allows
      JavaScript code to manipulate a website being displayed. More
      specifically, it sets or returns the HTML content (the inner HTML) of an
      element. The innerHTML property is widely used to modify the contents of a
      webpage as it is the easiest way of modifying DOM. But there are some
      disadvantages to using innerHTML in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <b>Disadvantages of using innerHTML property in JavaScript:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>The use of innerHTML very slow:</b>The process of using innerHTML is
        much slower as its contents as slowly built, also already parsed
        contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: </b>The event
        handlers do not get attached to the new elements created by setting
        innerHTML automatically. To do so one has to keep track of the event
        handlers and attach it to new elements manually. This may cause a memory
        leak on some browsers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Content is replaced everywhere:</b> Either you add, append, delete or
        modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced,
        also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Appending to innerHTML is not supported:</b>Usually, += is used for
        appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using
        innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <h2>Example:</h2>
      <p>
        &lt;p id="geek">Geeks&lt;/p&gt; <br />
        title = document.getElementById('#geek') <br />

        // The whole "geek" tag is reparsed <br />
        title.innerHTML += '&lt;p&gt; forGeeks &lt;/p&gt;' <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Old content replaced issue:</b>The old content is replaced even if
        object.innerHTML = object.innerHTML + ‘html’ is used instead of
        object.innerHTML += ‘html’. There is no way of appending without
        reparsing the whole innerHTML. Therefore, working with innerHTML becomes
        very slow. String concatenation just does not scale when dynamic DOM
        elements need to be created as the plus’ and quote openings and closings
        becomes difficult to track.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Can break the document:</b>There is no proper validation provided by
        innerHTML, so any valid HTML code can be used. This may break the
        document of JavaScript. Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to
        unexpected problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Can also be used for Cross-site Scripting(XSS):</b>The fact that
        innerHTML can add text and elements to the webpage, can easily be used
        by malicious users to manipulate and display undesirable or harmful
        elements within other HTML element tags. Cross-site Scripting may also
        lead to loss, leak and change of sensitive information.
      </li>
    </ul>
