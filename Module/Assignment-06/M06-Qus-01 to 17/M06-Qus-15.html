    <b>Qus:</b> What is the use of Void (0)? <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <p>
      You might have occasionally came across “javascript:void(0)” in an HTML
      Document. It is often used when inserting an expression in a web page
      might produce some unwanted effect. To remove this effect,
      “javascript:void(0)” is used. This expression returns undefined primitive
      value. This is often used with hyperlinks. Sometimes, you will decide to
      call some JavaScript from inside a link. Normally, when you click a link,
      the browser loads a brand new page or refreshes the same page (depending
      on the URL specified). But you most likely don’t desire this to happen if
      you have hooked up some JavaScript thereto link. To prevent the page from
      refreshing, you could use void(0).
