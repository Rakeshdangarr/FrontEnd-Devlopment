    <b>Qus:</b> What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
    <br />
    <b>Ans:</b> <br />
    <h1>View state</h1>
    <p>
      State management concerned with the client-side uses View state. It stores
      the information in text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons within a
      hidden field of a web page, not shared between the other web pages of the
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a POST event, it'll retain this information only accessible by
      elements of the same web page; however, loss of this information occurs as
      soon as another page is loaded.
    </p>
    <h1>Session state</h1>
    <p>
      Server-side state management utilizes user sessions to maintain
      information and its flow shared between the website's web pages. The web
      server stores the client session information and uses cookies to store
      keys associated with a particular client.
    </p>
    <p>
      Session expiration can clear a user's information. A timeout occurs due to
      a user's inactivity on a webpage, and the session expires to prevent data
      loss to non-authentic users.
    </p>
    <b
      >Although View state and Session state are both used for state management,
      the contrast between the two is high.</b

              <li>
                In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is
                available to user until the browser is closed or there is
                session expiration.

              <li>
                SessionState can be cleared by programmer or user or in case of
