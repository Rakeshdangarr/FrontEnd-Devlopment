    <b>Qus:</b> What are undeclared and undefined variables? <br />

    <b>Ans:</b> <br />
    <h1>Undeclared</h1>
    <p>
      When a variable is “undeclared,” it means that it has not been declared or
      defined in the current scope. In other words, it hasn’t been given a value
      or a type. This can happen if you try to use a variable without declaring
      it first, or if you misspell the variable name.
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <div>
      // This code will throw a ReferenceError because the variable "x" is
      undeclared <br />
      <br />
      console.log(x); <br />
      <p>
        Here, the console.log() statement is trying to log the value of the x
        variable, but x has not been declared anywhere in the code. As a result,
        JavaScript will throw a ReferenceError, indicating that x is not
        defined. <br />

        It’s important to note that undeclared variables are not the same as
        uninitialized variables. Uninitialized variables are those that have
        been declared, but have not been given a value.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>Undefined</h1>
    <p>
      undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in
      global scope. <br />

      In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable
      property. Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it. <br />

      A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A
      method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being
      evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if
      a value was not returned. <br />
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <div>
      /* This code will not throw an error because the variable "x" is declared,
      even though it has not been initialized with a value */ <br />
      let x; <br />
      console.log(x); // Output: undefined <br />
      <p>
        In this code, the let x statement declares the x variable, but does not
        initialize it with a value. As a result, when we try to log the value of
        x, the output is undefined.
