    <b>Qus:</b> What is Condition Statement?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <h1>Conditional Statements in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      <b>JavaScript Conditional statements</b>allow you to execute specific
      blocks of code based on conditions. If the condition meets then a
      particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute
      another block of action that satisfies that particular condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several methods that can be used to perform Conditional
      Statements in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>if statement:</b>Executes a block of code if a specified condition is
        true.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>else statement:</b> Executes a block of code if the same condition of
        the preceding if statement is false.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>else if statement:</b>Adds more conditions to the if statement,
        allowing for multiple alternative conditions to be tested.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>switch statement:</b>Evaluates an expression, then executes the case
        statement that matches the expression’s value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>ternary operator (conditional operator): </b> Provides a concise way
        to write if-else statements in a single line.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>JavaScript Conditional statements Examples:</h1>
    <ol>
      <h2><li>
        Using if Statement</h2>
        The if statement is used to evaluate a particular condition. If the
        condition holds true, the associated code block is executed.
        <div>
          <b>Syntax:</b> <br />
          <p>
            if ( condition ) {<br />
            // If the condition is met, <br />
            //code will get executed.<br />
            } <br />
          </p>
          <b>
            Example: In this example, we are using the if statement to find
            given number is even or odd.
          </b>
          <p>
            let num = 20; <br />
            <br />
            if (num % 2 === 0) {<br />
            console.log("Given number is even number.");<br />
            }<br />
            <br />
            if (num % 2 !== 0) {<br />
            console.log("Given number is odd number.");<br />
            };<br />
          </p>
          <b> Output </b>
          <p>Given number is even number.</p>
          <b
            >Explanation: This JavaScript code determines if the variable `num`
            is even or odd using the modulo operator `%`. If `num` is divisible
            by 2 without a remainder, it logs “Given number is even number.”
            Otherwise, it logs “Given number is odd number.”</b
          >
        </div>
      </li>
      <h2><li>Using if-else Statement</h2></li>
      <p>
        The if-else statement will perform some action for a specific condition.
        Here we are using the else statement in which the else statement is
        written after the if statement and it has no condition in their code
        block.
      </p>
      <div>
        <b>Syntax:</b> <br />
        <p>
          if (condition1) { <br />
          // Executes when condition1 is true<br />
          if (condition2) {<br />
          // Executes when condition2 is true<br />
          }<br />
          }<br />
        </p>
        <b
          >Example: In this example, we are using if-else conditional statement
          to check the driving licence eligibility date.</b
        >
        <p>
          let age = 25; <br />
          <br />
          if (age >= 18) { <br />
          console.log("You are eligible of driving licence") <br />
          } else { <br />
          console.log("You are not eligible for driving licence") <br />
          }; <br />
        </p>
        <b> Output </b> <br />
        <p>You are eligible of driving licence</p>
        <b
          >Explanation: This JavaScript code checks if the variable `age` is
          greater than or equal to 18. If true, it logs “You are eligible for a
          driving license.” Otherwise, it logs “You are not eligible for a
          driving license.” This indicates eligibility for driving based on
          age.</b
        >
      </div>
      <h2> <li>else if Statement</h2></li>
      <p>
        The else if statement in JavaScript allows handling multiple possible
        conditions and outputs, evaluating more than two options based on
        whether the conditions are true or false.
      </p>

      <div>
        <b>Syntax</b> <br />
        <p>
          if (1st condition) { <br />
          // Code for 1st condition <br />
          } else if (2nd condition) { <br />
          // ode for 2nd condition <br />
          } else if (3rd condition) { <br />
          // Code for 3rd condition <br />
          } else { <br />
          // ode that will execute if all <br />
          // above conditions are false <br />
          } <br />
        </p>
        <b
          >Example: In this example, we are using the above-explained
          approach.</b
        >
        <p>
          const num = 0; <br />
          <br />
          if (num > 0) { <br />
          console.log("Given number is positive."); <br />
          } else if (num < 0) { <br />
          console.log("Given number is negative."); <br />
          } else { <br />
          console.log("Given number is zero."); <br />
          }; <br />
        </p>
        <b>output</b>
        <p>Given number is zero.</p>
        <b
          >Explanation: This JavaScript code determines whether the constant
          `num` is positive, negative, or zero. If `num` is greater than 0, it
          logs “Given number is positive.” If `num` is less than 0, it logs
          “Given number is negative.” If neither condition is met (i.e., `num`
          is zero), it logs “Given number is zero.”</b
        >
      </div>
      <h2> <li><h2>Using Switch Statement (JavaScript Switch Case)</li></h2>
      <p>
        As the number of conditions increases, you can use multiple else-if
        statements in JavaScript. but when we dealing with many conditions, the
        switch statement may be a more preferred option.
      </p>
      <div>
        <b>Syntax:</b>
        <p>
          switch (expression) { <br />
          case value1: <br />
          statement1; <br />
          break; <br />
          case value2: <br />
          statement2; <br />
          break; <br />
          . . . <br />
          case valueN: <br />
          statementN; <br />
          break; <br />
          default: <br />
          statementDefault; <br />
          }; <br />
        </p>
        <b
          >Example: In this example, we find a branch name Based on the
          student’s marks, this switch statement assigns a specific engineering
          branch to the variable Branch. The output displays the student’s
          branch name,</b
        >
        <p>
          const marks = 85; <br>
 <br>
let Branch; <br>
 <br>
switch (true) { <br>
	case marks >= 90: <br>
		Branch = "Computer science engineering"; <br>
		break; <br>
	case marks >= 80: <br>
		Branch = "Mechanical engineering"; <br>
		break; <br>
	case marks >= 70: <br>
		Branch = "Chemical engineering"; <br>
		break; <br>
	case marks >= 60: <br>
		Branch = "Electronics and communication"; <br>
		break; <br>
	case marks >= 50: <br>
		Branch = "Civil engineering"; <br>
		break; <br>
	default: <br>
		Branch = "Bio technology"; <br>
		break; <br>
} <br>

console.log(`Student Branch name is : ${Branch}`); <br>

        </p>
        <b>Explanation:

          This JavaScript code assigns a branch of engineering to a student based on their marks. It uses a switch statement with cases for different mark ranges. The student’s branch is determined according to their marks and logged to the console.</b>

      <h2><li> Using Ternary Operator ( ?: )</li></h2>
      <p>The conditional operator, also referred to as the ternary operator (?:), is a shortcut for expressing conditional statements in JavaScript.</p>
      <div>
        <b>Syntax:</b>
        <p>condition ? value if true : value if false</p>
        <b>Example: In this example, we use the ternary operator to check if the user’s age is 18 or older. It prints eligibility for voting based on the condition.</b>
        <p>
          let age = 21;<br>
<br>
const result =<br>
	(age >= 18) ? "You are eligible to vote."<br>
		: "You are not eligible to vote.";<br>

console.log(result);<br>
<br>
        </p>
        <b>Output</b>
        <p>
          You are eligible to vote.

        </p>
        <b>Explanation: This JavaScript code checks if the variable `age` is greater than or equal to 18. If true, it assigns the string “You are eligible to vote.” to the variable `result`. Otherwise, it assigns “You are not eligible to vote.” The value of `result` is then logged to the console.</b>
