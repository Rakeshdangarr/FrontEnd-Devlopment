    <b>Qus:</b>Dynamic Form Validation in JS?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <p>
      Forms are an integral part of many websites. They are used to gather user
      information, feedback, and more. With JavaScript, it is possible to create
      form fields dynamically, allowing developers to add, remove, and
      manipulate form elements in real-time. This can be particularly useful for
      users who need to input multiple pieces of information, as well as for
      developers who want to create more dynamic and interactive forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this article, we will explore the process of creating form fields
      dynamically with JavaScript. We will cover the basics of creating form
      elements and manipulating them with JavaScript, as well as some more
      advanced techniques for making your forms even more dynamic and engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create Fields dynamically using JavaScript, we can use the
      document.createElement method to create the element. Then we can use the
      setAttribute method to set the element attributes and finally we can use
      the appendChild method to append the elements into the parent element.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Code:</h2>
    <p>The first thing we need to do is create our HTML File. I've only included three fields, two of them (Name and Email) are static and I make another Field dynamic, on which we will be performing the actions.</p>
    <p>After creating the files just paste the below HTML codes into your file. Make sure to save your HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.</p>
    <p>
      This is the basic structure of our dynamically form fields using HTML, and now we can move on to styling it using CSS.</p>
      <div>
        &lt;h1&gt;Dynamic Form Validation&lt;/h1&gt; <br>
        &lt;div class="container"&gt; <br>
        &lt;form action="" method="POST"&gt; <br>
          &lt;div id="formfield"&gt; <br>
            &lt;input type="text" name="text" class="text" size="50" placeholder="Name" required&gt; <br>
            &lt;input type="text" name="text" class="text" size="50" placeholder="Email" required&gt; <br>
            &lt;input type="text" name="text" class="text" size="50" placeholder="Optional Field"&gt; <br>
          &lt;/div&gt; <br>
          &lt;input name="submit" type="Submit" value="Submit"&gt; <br>
          &lt;/form&gt; <br>
          &lt;div class="controls"&gt; <br>
          &lt;button class="add" onclick="add()"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-plus"&gt;&lt;/i>Add&lt;/button&gt; <br>
          &lt;button class="remove" onclick="remove()"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-minus"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Remove&lt;/button&gt; <br>
          &lt;/div&gt; <br>
        </div>
    
      </div>
  </body>
