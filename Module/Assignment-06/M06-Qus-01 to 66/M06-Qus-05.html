    <b>Qus:</b> What the deference between undefined and undeclare in
    JavaScript?

    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <div>
      <table cellspacing="5px" cellpading="5px">
        <tr>
          <th>undeclared</th>

          <th>undefined</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>
                These are the variables that do not exist in the memory heap.
              </li>

              <li>
                The variables are considered to be undeclared because of
                programmer does not write them with var, let, or const.
              </li>

              <li>
                If we try to access them in the code execution phase then
                javascript will throw a Reference error.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </td>
          <td>
            <ul>
              <li>
                These variables are the ones that do exist in memory but nothing
                is being assigned to them explicitly by the programmer.
              </li>

              <li>
                The variables are considered to be undefined because it is
                assigned by javascript to them.
              </li>

              <li>
                If we try to access these variables weâ€™ll get the undefined as
                value.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
