    <b>Qus:</b>Form Validtion in JS?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>

    <h1>form Validtion</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>"This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).</li>
      <li>
        "Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific data
        format is required for it to be considered valid).
      </li>
      <li>
        "Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the
        right format).
      </li>
      <li>
        "Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain
        one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number." (A very specific data
        format is required for your data).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or
      the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format
      and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the
      browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the
      server is called server-side validation. In this chapter we are focusing
      on client-side validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the data
      to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; if the
      information isn't correctly formatted, it gives the user an error message
      explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We want to make filling out web forms as easy as possible. So why do we
      insist on validating our forms? There are three main reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>We want to get the right data, in the right format.</b> Our
        applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the
        wrong format, is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>We want to protect our users' data.</b>Forcing our users to enter
        secure passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>We want to protect ourselves. </b>There are many ways that malicious
        users can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Validating forms using JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over the look and feel
      of native error messages. In this section we will look at the different
      ways to do this.
