    <b>Qus:</b> What is JavaScript. How to use it?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      Javascript is
      <mark
        >a scripting language (scripting language is light weight programming
        language).</mark
      >
      It was design to add interactivity to HTML Pages. Javascript is an
      interpreted language means that scripts execute without preliminary
      compilation. It's code directly embedded to HTML Page. It works for all
      major browsers.

    <h1>How to use it</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language that is
      used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted,
      full-fledged programming language. JavaScript enables dynamic
      interactivity on websites when it is applied to an HTML document.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript helps the users to build modern web applications to interact
      directly without reloading the page every time. JavaScript is commonly
      used to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface by the
      DOM API. It is mainly used in web applications.
    </p>
    <b
      >Let's discuss the uses of JavaScript. Some of the uses of JavaScript are
      representing in the following points</b
    >
    <ol>
      <li>Web Applications</li>
      <p>
        As day-by-day there is a continuous improvement in the browsers, so
        JavaScript gained popularity for making robust web applications. We can
        understand it by taking the example of Google Maps. In Maps user just
        requires to click and drag the mouse; the details are visible just by a
        click. There is a use of JavaScript behind these concepts.
      </p>
      <li>Web Development</li>
      <p>
        JavaScript is commonly used for creating web pages. It allows us to add
        dynamic behavior to the webpage and add special effects to the webpage.
        On websites, it is mainly used for validation purposes. JavaScript helps
        us to execute complex actions and also enables the interaction of
        websites with visitors. Using JavaScript, it is also possible to load
        the content in a document without reloading the webpage.
      </p>
      <li>Mobile Applications</li>
      <p>
        Now a day's mobile devices are broadly used for accessing the internet.
        Using JavaScript, we can also build an application for non-web contexts.
        The features and uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating
        mobile applications. The React Native is the widely used JavaScript
        framework for creating mobile applications. Using React Native, we can
        build mobile applications for different operating systems. We do not
        require writing different codes for the iOS and Android operating
        systems. We only need to write it once and run it on different
        platforms.
      </p>
      <li>Game</li>
      <p>
        JavaScript is also used for creating games. It has various libraries and
        frameworks for creating a game. The game can either be a 2D or 3D. Some
        JavaScript game engines such as PhysicsJS, Pixi.js help us to create a
        web game. We can also use the WebGL (web graphics library), which is the
        JavaScript API to render 2D and 3D images on browsers.
      </p>
      <li>Presentations</li>
      <p>
        JavaScript also helps us to create presentations as a website. The
        libraries, such as RevealJs, and BespokeJs, can be used to create a
        web-based slide deck. They are easier to use, so we can easily make
        something amazing in a short time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Reveal.js is used to create interactive and beautiful slide decks
        with the help of HTML. These presentations work great with mobile
        devices and tablets. It also supports all of the CSS color formats. The
        BespokeJS includes animated bullet lists, responsive scaling, and a wide
        variety of features.
      </p>
      <li>Server Applications</li>
      <p>
        A large number of web applications have a server-side to them.
        JavaScript is used to generate content and handle HTTP requests.
        JavaScript can also run on servers through Node.js. The Node.js provides
        an environment containing the necessary tools required for JavaScript to
        run on servers.
      </p>
      <li>Web Servers</li>
      <p>
        A web server can be created by using Node.js. Node.js is event-driven
        and not waits for the response of the previous call. The servers created
        using Node.js are fast and don't use buffering and transfer chunks of
        data. The HTTP module can be used to create the server by using the
        createServer() method. This method executes when someone tries to access
        the port 8080. As a response, the HTTP server should display HTML and
        should be included in the HTTP header.
