    <b>Qus:</b>Write a JavaScript program to clone an array?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, cloning an array means creating a new array with the same
      elements as the original array. Cloning an array in JavaScript is useful
      when you want to create a new array that has the same elements as an
      existing array, without modifying the original array.
    </p>
    <h2>When to clone array?</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to perform some operations on an array, such as sorting,
      filtering, or mapping, but you donâ€™t want to modify the original array,
      you can create a clone of the original array and perform the operations on
      the clone instead.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When passing an array to a function as an argument, you may want to
        ensure that the function does not modify the original array. In this
        case, you can pass a clone of the array instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to preserve the original array for future reference, you can
        create a clone of the original array and use the clone for further
        processing or manipulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have an array that contains objects or arrays as elements, and
        you want to avoid modifying the original objects or arrays, you can
        create a clone of the array to work with, so that changes to the objects
        or arrays in the clone do not affect the original objects or arrays.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Using the Array.slice() Method</h2>
    <p>
      We use the slice method to create a shallow copy of an array. This method
      creates a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: This example shows the implementation of the above-explained
      approach.
    </p>
    <div>
      const originalArray = [1, 2, 3]; <br />
      const clonedArray = originalArray.slice(); <br />
      console.log(clonedArray); <br />
      <b>Output</b> <br />
      [1, 2, 3 ]
    </div>
  </body>
