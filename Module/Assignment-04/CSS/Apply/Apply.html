    <ol>
        <li>Inline CSS</li><br>
        <ul>

        </ul><br>

        <li>Internal CSS </li><br>
        <ul>
            <li>It's also known as embedded or internal CSS.</li>
            <li>We can apply it in the head section of HTML using &lt;style&gt; tag.</li>
            <li>This type of CSS is used when you want to change only one element on your website and don't want to affect other elements.</li>
            <li>This type of CSS will be used when you want to change only one element and it's very less frequent than external CSS file.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <li>External CSS</li><br>

        <ul>
            <li>We can apply it in an external file(.css) and then apply it using link tag using href attribute.</li>
            <li>External CSS file contain all the styling information for our website and then link this external styleSheet with your html document by adding an element inside the header tags.</li>
            <li>External CSS is less important</li>

    </ol>
</ul><br>

<h1>Advantages Of Using External Css:</h1><br>
<ul>

        <li>You can work on different sections like header, footer, content separately.</li>
        <li>If there are many pages with same designs only change will occur for all those pages instead of changing each and every single page manually.</li>
        <li>If any change comes up for all pages, this can be done easily from a single place.</li>
</ul>
