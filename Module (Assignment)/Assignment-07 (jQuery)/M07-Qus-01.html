    <b>Qus:</b> What is jQuery?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <p>
      jQuery is an open source JavaScript library that simplifies the
      interactions between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document
      Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript.
      <p>The only library available today that meets the needs of both designer types and programmer types is jQuery.</p>
      <p>Query is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more.” This philosophy can be further elaborated as three concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finding some elements (via CSS selectors) and doing something with them (via jQuery methods) i.e. locate a set of elements in the DOM, and then do something with that set of elements.</li>
        <li>Chaining multiple jQuery methods on a set of elements</li>
        <li>Using the jQuery wrapper and implicit iteration</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
