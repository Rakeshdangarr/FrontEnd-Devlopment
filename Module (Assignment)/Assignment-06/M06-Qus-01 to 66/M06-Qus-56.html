    <b>Qus:</b>Dynamic Form Validation in JS?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <p>
      Dynamic form validation in JavaScript is a technique used to validate form
      inputs in real-time, providing instant feedback to users. It is a powerful
      and flexible way to improve user experience and ensure the accuracy of
      data submitted through web forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways to implement dynamic form validation in JavaScript.
      One common approach is to bind input event handlers to each form field.
      When the user enters data into a field, the event handler is triggered and
      the input value is validated. If the input is invalid, an error message
      can be displayed to the user.
