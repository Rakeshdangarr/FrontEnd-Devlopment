    <b>Qus:</b> What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript
    objects?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <div>
      <b
        >There are a few disadvantages to drawback methods directly in
        JavaScript objects.</b

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Performance:</b>Declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects
          can lead to performance problems, especially if the object is
          instantiated many times. This is because each time the object is
          instantiated, a new copy of the method is created.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Readability:</b>Declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects
          can make the code more difficult to read and maintain. This is because
          the methods are not grouped together in a logical way.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Reusability:</b>Declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects
          can make it difficult to reuse the methods in other objects. This is
          because the methods are not defined in a central location.
        </li>
