    <b>Qus:</b>
    <h1>What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h1>

    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <div>
      <h2>Bootstrap Container</h2>
      <p>
        Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain,
        pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.
      </p>

      <b>how does it work</b>
      <p>
        Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are
        required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to
        contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While
        containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested
        container.
      </p>
      <p>Bootstrap comes with three different containers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
        </li>
        <li>.container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints</li>
        <li>
          .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified
          breakpoint
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
