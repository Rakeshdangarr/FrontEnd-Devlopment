    <b>Qus:</b> How to embed audio and video in a webpage? <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <h1>Audio</h1>
    To embed audio in HTML, we use the &lt; audio &gt; tag. Before HTML5, audio
    cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we
    used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is possible.
    This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three audio
    formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio
    format. <br />

    <h4>Example</h4>
    &lt; audio &gt; <br />
    &lt; source src="file name" type "audio file type" <br />
    &lt; audio &gt; <br />
    <h2>Audio Attribute Specification</h2>
    <br />
    The HTML5 audio tag can have a number of attributes to control the look and
    feel and various functionalities of the control −
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b> autoplay</b> <br />
        This Boolean attribute if specified, the audio will automatically begin
        to play back as soon as it can do so without stopping to finish loading
        the data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>autobuffer</b> <br />This Boolean attribute if specified, the audio
        will automatically begin buffering even if it's not set to automatically
        play.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>controls</b> <br />If this attribute is present, it will allow the
        user to control audio playback, including volume, seeking, and
        pause/resume playback.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> loop</b> <br />This Boolean attribute if specified, will allow audio
        automatically seek back to the start after reaching at the end.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> preload</b> <br />This attribute specifies that the audio will be
        loaded at page load, and ready to run. Ignored if autoplay is present.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> src</b> <br />The URL of the audio to embed. This is optional; you
        may instead use the &lt;source /&gt; element within the video block to
        specify the video to embed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Video</h1>
    as per use audio tag in html as well as we can use &lt;video&gt; tag and
    play video.The current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which
    video formats browsers should support in the video tag.You can use
    <source />
    tag to specify media along with media type and many other attributes. A
    video element allows multiple source elements and browser will use the first
    recognized format <br />
