    <b>Qus:</b> How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>

    <p>
      In JavaScript, you can force a page to load another page by using the
      window.location object. There are a few methods to achieve this. To force
      a page to load another page in JavaScript, we have multiple approaches:

      >Below are the approaches used to force a page to load another page in
      JavaScript:</b
    >
    <ul>
      <li>Using window.location.replace</li>
      <li>Using window.location.assign Property</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
    <h1>Using window.location.replace</h1>
    <p>
      The replace function is used to navigate to a new URL without adding a new
      record to the history.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h1>Using window.location.assign Property</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The assign function is similar to the href property as it is also used
        to navigate to a new URL.
      </li>
      <li>
        The assign method, however, does not show the current location, it is
        only used to go to a new location.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unlike the replace method, the assign method adds a new record to
        history (so that when the user clicks the “Back” button, he/she can
        return to the current page).
      </li>
    </ul>
