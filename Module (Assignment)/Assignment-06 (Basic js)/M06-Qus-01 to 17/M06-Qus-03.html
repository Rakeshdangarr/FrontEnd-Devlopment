    <b>Qus:</b> What is negative Infinity? <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <h1>negstive Infinity</h1>
    <p>
      The Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY value behaves slightly differently than
      mathematical infinity:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any positive value, including POSITIVE_INFINITY, multiplied by
        NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any negative value, including NEGATIVE_INFINITY, multiplied by
        NEGATIVE_INFINITY is POSITIVE_INFINITY.
      </li>
      <li>Zero multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NaN.</li>
      <li>NaN multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NaN.</li>
      <li>
        NEGATIVE_INFINITY, divided by any negative value except
        NEGATIVE_INFINITY, is POSITIVE_INFINITY.
      </li>
      <li>
        NEGATIVE_INFINITY, divided by any positive value except
        POSITIVE_INFINITY, is NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
      </li>
      <li>
        NEGATIVE_INFINITY, divided by either NEGATIVE_INFINITY or
        POSITIVE_INFINITY, is NaN.
      </li>
      <li>
        x > Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY is true for any number x that isn't
        NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You might use the Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY property to indicate an error
      condition that returns a finite number in case of success. Note, however,
      that NaN would be more appropriate in such a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a static property of Number, you always use
      it as Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY, rather than as a property of a number
      value.
    </p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <b>Using NEGATIVE_INFINITY</b>
    <p>
      In the following example, the variable smallNumber is assigned a value
      that is smaller than the minimum value. When the if statement executes,
      smallNumber has the value -Infinity, so smallNumber is set to a more
      manageable value before continuing.
    </p>
    <div>
      let smallNumber = -Number.MAX_VALUE * 2; <br />

      if (smallNumber === Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) { <br />
      smallNumber = returnFinite(); <br />
      }
    </div>
  </body>
