    <b>Qus:</b>  What do you understand by CSS opacity?<br>

        <b>Ans:</b>
        <p>The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0 is completely transparent. and also When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements become transparent as well. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read. If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, use RGBA color values instead</p>
