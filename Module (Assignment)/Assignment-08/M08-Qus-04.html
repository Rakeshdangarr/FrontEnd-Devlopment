    <h2>What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h2>

    <br />

    <b>Ans:</b>
    <div>
      <h1>Bootstrap Grid System</h1>
      <p>Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.</p>
      <p>
        If you do not want to use all 12 column individually, you can group the
        columns together to create wider columns
      </p>
      <p>
        Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange
        depending on the screen size: On a big screen it might look better with
        the content organized in three columns, but on a small screen it would
        be better if the content items were stacked on top of each other.
      </p>

      <h2>Grid Classes</h2>
      <p>The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)</li>
        <li>sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)</li>
        <li>
          md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
        </li>
        <li>
          lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px
          wide)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
