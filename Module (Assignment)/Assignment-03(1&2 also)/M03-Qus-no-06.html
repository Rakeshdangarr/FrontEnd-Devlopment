    <b>Qus:</b> What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.<br><br>

    <b>Ans:</b><br><br>
    <b><mark>Class selectors</mark></b><br>
    <p>the class identifier, used to classify elements into a conceptual group. Unlike the id attribute, multiple 
    elements may share a class name. Not only that, an element may belong to more than one class. You 
    can target elements belonging to the same class with, you guessed it, a class selector. Class names are 
    indicated with a period (.) in the selector. For example, to select all paragraphs with class="special", 
    use this selector (the period indicates the following word is a class selector)</p>
