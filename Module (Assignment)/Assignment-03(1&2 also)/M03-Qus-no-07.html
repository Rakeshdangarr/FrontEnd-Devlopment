    <b>Qus:</b>What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
    elements? With Example<br><br>

    <b>Ans:</b><br>

    <p>While an ID is specific to a single element, classes can be assigned to multiple elements on a page or throughout the website.  <br> They are not unique. And while a single element can only have one ID, it can have multiple classes</p>
